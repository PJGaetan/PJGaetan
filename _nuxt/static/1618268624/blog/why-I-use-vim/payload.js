I still enjoyed myself\nputting my new skills to the test once in a while, taking notes, or wrinting\na commit message.\n\nDay by day, I got more and more frustrated in my way of coding. I either knew\nthere was a better way to do that un vim, or opened vim in a separete\nterminal, copy\u002Fpaste some code, use some macro on it and then put it back.\n\nIt's when I decided to go for vim keybinding in my editor (I use vscode). It\nwas a life changer and I guess there is no turning back anymore. I do have\na personnal project that I work on using exclusively vim. It gave me the\nopportunity to lean about fuzzy finder, to create a file navigation workflow.\nLatly I've fallen in love with\n[telescope](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fnvim-telescope\u002Ftelescope.nvim) go and check it\nout if you don't know about it already.\n")));
